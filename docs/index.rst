Welcome to Cookiecutter for Python Packages
===========================================

This project aims to provide a structure for new and existing Python projects
along with a guide on how to complete a project to include tests, 
documentation, console scripts (executables), code coverage and helpful
linters.

For new users to Python this project can provide a helpful jump start and a one
stop reference to all important basic steps a project needs to be complete.
For existing Python users, this project can provide an easy to replicate
project structure with features usable right out of the box.

This project is a Cookiecutter_ template.
